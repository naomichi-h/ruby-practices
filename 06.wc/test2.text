A structure for nucleic acid has already been
proposed by Pauling and Corey. They kindly
made their manuscript available to us in
advance of publication. Their model consists
of three intertwined chains, with the
phosphates near the fibre axis, and the bases
on the outside. In our opinion, this structure
is unsatisfactory for two reasons: (1) We
believe that the material which gives the Xray diagrams is the salt, not the free acid.
Without the acidic hydrogen atoms it is not
clear what forces would hold the structure
together, especially as the negatively charged
phosphates near the axis will repel each other.
(2) Some of the van Der Waals distances
appear to be too small.
